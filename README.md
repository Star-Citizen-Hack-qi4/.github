## 🌌 What’s Star Citizen?

Massive open-world space sim meets FPS combat, bounty hunting, and interstellar trading. *Star Citizen* is still in alpha but already bigger than most finished games.

* Fly detailed ships across galaxies
* Shoot it out FPS-style in bunkers
* Trade, mine, bounty hunt, smuggle
* ...and fight other players who *also* want your loot 🪐

But the grind is real, the bugs are brutal, and losing your haul to random lag is pain. That’s why some pilots use a **hack suite** to bend the stars to their will 🌠
